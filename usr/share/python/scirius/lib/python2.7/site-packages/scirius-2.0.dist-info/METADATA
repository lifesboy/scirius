Scirius CE is developed by `Stamus Networks <https://www.stamus-networks.com/>`_ and is available under the
GNU GPLv3 license.

Features
========

Scirius can build Suricata ruleset composed of different sources. Sources or feeds can be picked from public sources
published by `OISF <https://oisf.net/>`_ or can be custom.

Scirius will take care of refreshing the sources and composing the ruleset by applying your transformation
on it.

Transformations like disabling a rule or applying a threshold (to lower the noise only) can be made
for each rule or at the category level.
